# Zenotta Network Protocol

A repo for the development of the Zenotta Network Protocol (ZNP).

[[_TOC_]]

..

## Setup

The Zenotta Network Protocol (in fact, almost all of Zenotta's code) runs on Rust, so installing this is the first step before dealing with any code. You can install `rustup`, Rust's toolchain installer, by running the following:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

When asked how to proceed, simply selecting the option `1) Proceed with installation` is generally the best. You can then run the following to update the `PATH` variable and check whether everything installed correctly:

```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustc --version
```

If the terminal responds with the `rustc` version you're currently running then everything went well and you're ready to go. 

### Linux

Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.01 LTS) may require extra package installations depending on what you've developed before. The following package installs assume a completely new machine instance, and should cover everything you need to get going:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install m4
sudo apt-get install llvm
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev
```

### Repo Setup

You can then set up the project on your local machine using the following steps:

- Clone this repo using one of the options in Gitlab
- From your terminal, move into the cloned folder on your local machine
- Run the following:

```
make
```

You will also require a local instance of the Zenotta `NAOM` repo, which is a crate dependency. The dependency 
is listed in the `Cargo.toml` as:

```
naom = { path = "../naom" }
```

The path can be changed as needed. Once done you can build the project using `cargo build` and run it using `cargo run`, as per usual.

..

## Running Nodes Locally

You can build everything by running

```rust
cargo build --release
```

This will compile everything into a release state, from which you can then run your nodes locally. The following are example commands for each type to get you up and running quickly:

- **Compute**: `RUST_LOG="$COMPUTE_LOG" target/release/compute --config=src/bin/node_settings_local_raft_1.toml`
- **Storage**: `RUST_LOG=warp target/release/storage --config=src/bin/node_settings_local_raft_1.toml`
- **Miner**: `RUST_LOG="$MINER_LOG" target/release/user --config=src/bin/node_settings_local_raft_1.toml`
- **User**: `RUST_LOG=warp target/release/user --config=src/bin/node_settings_local_raft_1.toml`

You can provide a number of flags to the command depending on the type of node:

### Compute

- ```config```: The configuration to run the node with
- ```initial_block_config```: The initial block config to run the node with
- ```index```: Run the specified compute node index from config file

### Storage

- ```config```: The configuration to run the node with
- ```api_port```: The API port to run the node with
- ```index```: Run the specified compute node index from config file

### Miner

- ```config```: The configuration to run the node with
- ```compute_index```: Endpoint index of a compute node that the miner should connect to
- ```storage_index```: Endpoint index of a storage node that the miner should connect to
- ```index```: Run the specified compute node index from config file
- ```request_bc_item```: Key (hash or name) of the blockchain item to request from storage
- ```passphrase```: Enter a password or passphase for the encryption of the Wallet

### User

- ```config```: The configuration to run the node with
- ```api_port```: The API port to run the node with
- ```compute_index```: Endpoint index of a compute node that the miner should connect to
- ```peer_user_index```: Endpoint index of a peer user node that the user should connect to
- ```amount```: The amount of tokens to send to the peer's recipient address
- ```index```: Run the specified compute node index from config file
- ```passphrase```: Enter a password or passphase for the encryption of the Wallet

## Git Flow

**When working on this repo, please ensure that any branches you may create pull from `develop` regularly. In doing this you 
ensure that your local version has the latest code for the project and minimizes the possibility of unnecessary merge 
conflicts.**

Zenotta's Git flow generally involves working on each new task in a new branch, which you should checkout from `develop` and can be done as in the following example

```
git checkout -b branch_name
```

where `branch_name` would be replaced with your chosen branch name. There is no general branch naming convention aside from two cases:

- *New features*: These should be prefixed with `feature_` and then the branch name (eg. `feature_new_cool_feature`)
- *Bugfixes*: These should be prefixed with `bugfix_` and then the branch name (eg. `bugfix_new_damn_bug`)

Beyond this, it is only expected that branches have sensible naming that describes what the branch involves or is for.

## Documentation

Documentation can be built locally with rustdoc by running the following command:

```
cargo +nightly doc --document-private-items
```

The resulting documentation can be found in `target/doc/system/index.html`.

Nightly is required because one of dependencies (`gmp-mpfr-sys`) uses unstable features.
